## Using the library
Recent vvvv versions (>= 2021.4.7) have this package pre-installed. Simply open the node browser and select the `VL.Audio` package.

In order to use this library with earlier versions, you'll have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) in the documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.Audio

Once the VL.Audio nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document you'll see the category "Audio" in the nodebrowser. Press F1 to open the Help Browser and search for the term "audio" to see relevant how-to patches.
